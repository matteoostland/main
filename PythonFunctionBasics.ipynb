    "# Functions in Python\n",
    "Python allows users to write functions for specific tasks and then build larger, more complicated programs from those function. Functions take specific input (input arguments), carries out a task, and returns output arguments. You can save functions to a file and call them from other scripts, notebooks, or functions that you write. \n",
    "To define a function in Python use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def func1(input1, input2,...):\n",
    "    indented code statements\n",
    "    return output(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Keep in mind, indentation is **everything in Python**. The function ends whenever the indentation ends. \n"
