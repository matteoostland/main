    "# Drawing from Probability Distributions\n",

    "In the previous section we learned how to generate random numbers from\n",
    "a uniform probability distribution in an interval $[a,b]$. This\n",
    "distribution was normalized, so that $$\\int _a^b {P(x)dx}=1.$$ Hence, the uniform distribution *by definition* is\n",
    "$P(x)=1/(b-a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we generate a sequence $\\{x_i\\}$ and we take some\n",
    "function of it to generate $\\{y(x_i)\\}=\\{y_i\\}$. This new sequence is\n",
    "going to be distributed according to some probability density $P(y)$,\n",
    "such that $$P(y)dy=P(x)dx$$ or $$P(y)=P(x)\\frac{dx}{dy}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to generate a desired normalized distribution $P(y)$ from a uniform distribution $P(x)$, we need\n",
    "to solve the differential equation: $$\\frac{dx}{dy}=P(y).$$ But the\n",

    "Many of the particles produced at accelerations like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Fermilab, and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are classified as \"resonances\". In practical terms resonances are just unstable particles, that is particles that decay. These resonances are subject to the energy-time uncertainty principle $$\\Delta E \\Delta t \\sim \\hbar$$ that is, the mass of resonances take a range of possible values depending on their lifetime. The mass values of resonances are modeled using a Breit-Wigner distribution:\n",
